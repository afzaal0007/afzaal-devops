touch file1 file2 file3

touch file-'date +%d-%M-%Y'       Create file with today's Date

touch text{1..100}.txt        create files from 1 to 100

cat file1

cat > file5 

This is a good file. I created this file while learning linux positively :) and text will be added in the file5 from above command

cat >> file5

Just appending some more text to file5 and continue learning linux slowly but surely :)


cat -n file5         Read the file with the line numbers


cat -b file5         File with line numbers but not counting empty line
