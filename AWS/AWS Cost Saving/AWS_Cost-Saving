Right Size Using Performance Data: 


Analyze performance data to right size your EC2 instances.
Identify 

1. idle instances 

2. ones that are underutilized.

Key metrics to look for are: 

1 CPU usage 
2.memory usage.
3. Identify instances with a maximum CPU usage and memory usage of less than 40% over a four-week period.

compute-optimized instances:


For storage-optimized instances (I2 and D2 instance types), 

1. high data IOPS, 

2. focus on IOPS to see whether instances are overprovisioned.
